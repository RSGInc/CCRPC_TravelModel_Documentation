<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="about-ccrpc">About CCRPC</h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation requires every metropolitan area
with a population over 50,000 to have a designated Metropolitan Planning
Organization (MPO) to qualify for receipt of federal highway and transit
funds. The Governor of Vermont has designated the Chittenden County
Regional Planning Commission (CCRPC) as the MPO responsible for
transportation planning in Chittenden County.</p>
<p>To establish and maintain the certifiable transportation planning
process required by the federal government as a precondition for receipt
of federal transportation funding, the CCRPC as the designated MPO for
the region must at a minimum produce and maintain three major products;
they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Long Range Metropolitan Transportation Plan (LRTP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Unified Planning Work Program (UPWP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fundamental to this planning process is the need to understand future
travel patterns and be able to analyze and make judgments on the
relative merits of alternative future transportation investments
throughout the Chittenden County. The CCRPC plans, prioritizes, and
coordinates the use of federal transportation funds in Chittenden County
and to accomplish these objectives the CCRPC has commissioned the
development of a sophisticated system of computer models capable of
analyzing future travel behavior and transportation system performance.</p>
<h2 id="about-modeling-requirements">About Modeling Requirements</h2>
<p>Joint FHWA/FTA planning regulations require that forecasts of future
travel used in an area's transportation plan be based on an "analytical
process". The sophistication of that analytical process is generally
left to the discretion of the local planning agency. MPOs representing
urbanized areas with a population over 200,000 are designated as
Transportation Management Areas (TMAs) and must undergo a more formal
certification review by FHWA and FTA field staff every three years.
While it is theoretically possible for even a TMA to satisfy its
"analytical process" without a travel model, it is not likely to have an
adequate transportation planning process without one.</p>
<p>Beyond the Federal joint planning requirements, an MPO may need a travel
model to satisfy two other Federal requirements. First, if a TMA is also
an air quality non-attainment area that is serious or above for either
ozone or carbon monoxide, EPA's Conformity Rule requires that forecasts
of regional vehicle emissions must be based on an estimate of VMT
derived from a network-based travel model meeting certain minimal
modeling requirements. Second, FTA's New Starts criteria for major
transit investment require forecasts of future transit demand that can
only be derived using travel models.</p>
<p>The accepted practice for major transportation studies by any mode
generally involves using relatively sophisticated demand models and
network models. Modeling practice has evolved over the last 20 years to
the point where many different transportation and land use scenarios can
be evaluated on their relative merits for these studies. MPOs and their
partnering agencies usually program regular updates to keep their models
consistent and up-to-date with accepted practices.</p>
<h1 id="ccrpc-model-overview">CCRPC Model Overview</h1>
<p>The Chittenden County Travel Demand Model, Version 4 (“the model”) is an
integrated transportation demand model developed by Resource Systems
Group (RSG) for the Chittenden County Regional Planning Commission.</p>
<p>The model estimates the movement of people and vehicles within the
region during an average fall weekday in 2015. The 2015 Model is a daily
model with hourly traffic assignments. The 2015 model is based on
updated housing and employment estimates from 2015[^1], and includes a
revised network. The model has also been transferred from TransCAD 5.0
to TransCAD 7.0. The model includes 528 internal Transportation Analysis
Zones (TAZs) covering the 19 municipalities in Chittenden County.
Traffic entering and exiting the region does so through 17 external
zones.</p>
<p>Transportation planners can use the model to perform comprehensive
regional transportation analyses, and to evaluate traffic impacts
resulting from:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>multi-modal transportation improvements,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>changes in traveler behavior,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>changes to the roadway system,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>changes in land use activity, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementation of demand management strategies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of this report is to describe:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the data sources and parameter estimation that are the foundation of
  the model,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the structure of the model itself,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the use of the model for forecasting purposes, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the history of enhancements and changes made to the model.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conceptual-overview-of-model-structure">Conceptual Overview of Model Structure</h2>
<p>The CCRPC model is based on a four-step modeling process: trip
generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and vehicle assignment. An
overview of the model system is shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p>At the start of a full model run, trip generation uses land use data to
calculate person trip ends at the transportation analysis zone (TAZ)
level. These person trip ends are then paired into origins and
destinations in the distribution model. In the next step, the person
trips are split into each respective mode (e.g. auto, bus). Finally, the
vehicle trips are assigned to the highway network in the assignment
model.</p>
<p><span id="_Ref489356643" class="anchor"></span>Figure : 4-Step Model
Concept</p>
<p><img src="assets/media/image5.png"
style="width:6.25in;height:0.50681in" /></p>
<p>The model has an important feedback loop that has been added in Figure
2. Accessibility, which is a measure of the relative ease of travel, is
calculated based on outputs from the assignment model, which is also an
important determinant of trip distribution. Simply put, the decisions
individuals make about where and how far to travel are a function of
congestion levels and travel times. Therefore, it is customary to
iterate between the trip distribution and assignment models in order to
reach a convergent solution. The iteration loop in Figure 2 occurs
within a given simulation year.</p>
<p><span id="_Ref489356654" class="anchor"></span>Figure : 4-Step Model
Concept with Feedback</p>
<p><img src="assets/media/image6.png"
style="width:6.25in;height:1.41961in" /></p>
<p>While transit travel is critical for many people in the CCRPC region,
the reality is that transit carries a relatively small portion of the
overall travel market in the region at this time. Since transit demand
in the CCRPC region does not measurably impact roadway level-of-service,
a decision was made to not include the mode choice model in the feedback
loop to reduce model run time and complexity. However, the mode choice
model is still part of the overall model, and the CCRPC model operates
as presented in Figure 3. This model application decision does not limit
the ability of the modeling system to adequately represent non-auto
modes, and does not bias the model results, but it does significantly
reduce model run time since the mode choice component takes the longest
to run due to the nature of the complex path-building that is required.</p>
<p><span id="_Ref489356699" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Feedback in the
CCRPC Model Structure</p>
<p><img src="assets/media/image7.png"
style="width:6.25in;height:0.93616in" /></p>
<p>The model is calibrated to reflect traffic conditions on an average
weekday in September, 2015. September was chosen because it is a time
during which public schools and colleges are in session, while seasonal
(summer) traffic is still observed.</p>
<p>The model is a daily model that performs hourly traffic assignments so
as to account for both travel across an entire day and to adequately
depict peak hour congestion. To accomplish this, the model relies on
static time of day factors that divide the daily trips by hour for the
purposes of assignment. This process is illustrated in Figure 4.</p>

<h2 id="brief-description-of-model-components">Brief Description of Model Components</h2>
<p>While the model is a traditional 4-step model, the modeling process
itself consists of several steps worth noting. Each of the steps below
will be discussed in-depth later in the document.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Daily trip generation</strong>, which calculates the number of person trip
  ends generated by and attracted to each zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Daily trip distribution</strong>, which pairs the trip-ends for each zone
  for each of six trip purposes. The result of this is a person trip
  table for each trip type. One output of trip distribution is the
  person trip table for home to work that can be compared to the
  “Journey-to-Work” data provided by the Census Bureau.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time of day (diurnal) distribution</strong>, which takes the daily
  production-attraction trip matrices and converts them to
  origin-destination matrices by time period (e.g. AM peak hour). Trips
  by time of day were initially estimated using the CCRPC trip diary
  survey and the NHTS in the previous version of this model (version 3).
  For this effort, adjustments to the diurnal distribution were made
  based on daily traffic profiles observed from over 30 automatic
  traffic recorder (ATR) count stations across Chittenden County.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vehicle assignment</strong>, the most widely used model, which locates the
  best routes between each origin/destination pair and assigns the
  vehicle trips accordingly. An important output of this step is the
  number of vehicles on each roadway segment. Several other pieces of
  data can be extracted, including operating speeds, travel times, VMT,
  VHT, and V/C. In addition, one can configure the vehicle assignment to
  save all the vehicle trips that use a single link in either direction
  (select link analysis) or all the vehicle trips that originate or are
  destined for a zone (select zone analysis).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highway/transit skim builder</strong> finds the best available travel path
  via each of the travel modes explicitly modeled, and describes the
  attributes of the best paths for each mode (i.e. travel time, cost,
  distance, etc.). Several modes are explicitly modeled in the CCRPC
  model, including auto, transit modes (bus, rail) and non-motorized
  modes. Skims are reasonable approximations of the travel time and cost
  between all pairs of TAZs, and skims are described for each travel
  mode. The path-finding algorithms are calibrated based on observed
  travel paths and observed relationships between volumes and congested
  speeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mode choice model</strong> calculates which mode the person trips are
  likely to take based on availability and mode-specific parameters
  (e.g. time, cost, transit frequency). Mode choice provides a breakdown
  of person trips by mode. The mode choice model is developed based on
  observed data on mode preferences and what those preferences imply
  about sensitivities to mode attributes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="network-and-zonal-structure">Network and Zonal Structure</h1>
<p>The CCRPC Model is a zone-based forecasting tool, modeling traffic flows
between transportation analysis zones (TAZs). The corresponding
transportation network includes all segments functionally classified as
collectors and above, as well as some more prominent local roads.</p>
<h2 id="taz-structure">TAZ Structure</h2>
<p>For the purposes of modeling traffic flow, the model includes 528
internal Transportation Analysis Zones (TAZs) covering the 19
municipalities in Chittenden County. Traffic entering and exiting the
region does so through 17 external zones.</p>

<p>There are 68,272 households within the model region and 7,749 group
quarters. Group quarters are treated as 75% one person-zero vehicle and
25% two person-one vehicle households. Group quarters are not
multi-family or apartment buildings. These are most typically student

<h2 id="employment">Employment</h2>
<p>The CCRPC collected employment land use data from two distinct sources:
Dunn &amp; Bradstreet employment data provider and the Vermont Department of
Employment and Training (DET). The CCRPC supplemented gaps in the Dunn &amp;
Bradstreet data using the VT DET data. The Dunn &amp; Bradstreet data
contains information such as the name of the employer, the address of
the employer, the general number of employees, and the employer’s NAICS
code. The NAICS codes were consolidated into Standard Industrial
Classification (SIC) codes.</p>
<p>Based on the addresses of the employers, CCRPC was able to geocode 6,439
of 7,014 total employers. For those addresses that were not easily
geocoded, the CCRPC focused more resources to those employers with more
than 5 employees. Based on this effort, the CCRPC was able to strike
93,217 of 94,733 total employees included in the dataset.</p>
<p>Once the employment data was geocoded, each employer could be assigned
to one of the 528 internal transportation analysis zones (TAZs).</p>
<p>Employment was then aggregated into nine employment categories created
to reflect particular trip attraction similarities: Accommodations,
College, Commercial, Industrial, Institutional, K-12 School, Retail,
Special Commercial, and Special Retail. Figure 8 shows the
categorization of the SIC codes.</p>

<p><span id="_Ref489434397" class="anchor"></span>Table : Total Trips by
Trip Purpose</p>
<p>At this stage trip ends are categorized as “productions” and
“attractions.” Production ends occur at the trip maker’s residence. Trip
productions are based on the number and type of housing units within a
TAZ. For non-home-based trips, where the residence is not on either end
of the trip, productions are calculated based on the predilections of
household occupants to make these types of trips and is estimated
statistically from survey data.</p>
<p>Attraction ends are based on the number of non-home land uses including
workplaces, shops, other residences and schools. The total number of
attractions for each trip type is set equal to the total number of
productions. If productions and attractions are out of balance, the
attractions are adjusted to match total regional productions.</p>
<p>Productions and attractions are different than origins and destinations
in that they do not indicate the true direction of travel. When one
leaves home for work in the morning, the origin (home) is also the
production. In the afternoon, when one returns home from work, it is the
destination (home) which is the production.</p>
<p>Daily trip production and attraction models were developed for earlier
iterations of the CCRPC model from a combination of sources, including
the 1998 CCRPC household diary survey, the 2001 and 2009 National
Household Travel Surveys (NHTS), the ITE trip generation manual, and
comparison to other models.</p>
<h2 id="trip-production-rates">Trip Production Rates</h2>
<p>The CCRPC model uses a cross-classification approach to estimating trip
productions. This approach is widely used in other regional network
models. For each TAZ, households are cross-classified according to size
(1 person, 2 persons, 3 persons, or 4+ persons) and auto ownership (0
auto, 1 auto, 2 autos, or 3+ autos). The cross-classification approach
required that separate trip production estimates be developed for each
of the resulting 16 household types (4 x 4).</p>
<p>Table 6 shows the trip production rates for internal HBW, HBO and NHB
trip productions. The production rates were estimated using the 1998
Chittenden County household survey and the 2001 NHTS survey. CCRPC
purchased the Add-On data for the 2009 NHTS which was also used to check
and update the trip production rates, and were further informed by an
rMove™ convenience survey conducted by RSG for the CCRPC in the fall of
2016. Each number entered into the production tables is in units of
person trips per household per day. The trip generation rates were
adjusted by comparing them to rates from newer surveys for similar
geographical regions.</p>

<h2 id="internal-trip-attractions">Internal Trip Attractions</h2>
<p>Trip attraction models for HBW, HBO and NHB trip purposes were developed
originally from the CCRPC diary survey and the light, medium and heavy
commercial trip rates came from FHWA’s Quick Response Freight Manual
(DTFH61-93-C-00075 &amp; DTFH61-93-C-00216, Sept-1996,
<u>http://tmip.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/clearinghouse/docs/quick/quick.pdf</u>).
The estimated model coefficients were then calibrated so that trip
attractions by purpose would be consistent with trip productions and
proportionate to historic ITE trip generation rates by land-use type.
Each number entered into the attraction table (Table 10) is in units of
person trips per employee or housing unit per day.</p>

<p><span id="_Toc491103353" class="anchor"></span>Table : 2015 IX and XI
Daily Vehicle Trips, by External TAZ</p>
<h2 id="external-trips">External Trips</h2>
<p>Trips are further categorized based on whether both the origin and
destination are internal to Chittenden County, or whether the trip has
an external trip end. External trips can be classified as
internal-to-external (IX), external-to-internal (XI), or
external-to-external (XX).</p>
<p>Simple trip generation and distribution models cannot estimate these
types of trips since land use data would need to be estimated for all
areas outside the model region. Instead, to assist in estimating these
types of trips, counts are taken at selected roads at the boundary of
the model. These roads are termed external load links. Trips from
outside the network are loaded into the network through these links.</p>
<p><span id="_Toc491103327" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Location of
External TAZs</p>
<p><img src="assets/media/image13.png"
style="width:5.28148in;height:7.17672in" /></p>
<p>In the base year, the total IX, XI and XX trips are set to match base
year traffic count data at the external stations. The percent of XX
trips is derived in large part from an external license plate survey
conducted for earlier model iteration in August 2004, while the
remaining external trips will be split among IX and XI trips based on
the AM and PM directional imbalance observed in traffic counts as a
proxy for the home-end (production) locations of the trips. We assume
for most external TAZs that the IX and XI trips will be 35%
internal-to-external (IX) and 65% external-to-internal (XI), meaning
approximately 2/3 of the IXXI demand will be generated externally (i.e.
by people who live outside the region). These assumptions are allowed to
vary by external TAZ location and do for I-89 south of the region, where
the split is 55/45 in favor of XI trips.</p>
<h3 id="external-travel-survey">External Travel Survey</h3>
<p>In order to estimate the volume of external-external and
external-internal traffic, for both trucks and passenger cars, a license
plate survey was performed for a previous model iteration (version 2) in
August 2004 to collect license plate data on I-89 at the southern and
northern edges of the study region. The goal was to record every license
plate and vehicle classification, and also to track the percentage of
vehicles traveling through the county.</p>
<p>The southern boundary of the study area is between the Waterbury (Exit
10) and the Richmond (Exit 11) and the northern boundary is between the
Georgia Center (Exit 18) and the St. Albans (Exit 19). All of the survey
sites were located at the rest stops between Exits 10 and 11 and Exits
18 and 19. Each site consisted of a professional photographer with a
digital camera and a counter who counted every vehicle, and both were
located on the grass just next to the highway between the rest stop and
the road.</p>
<p>These data were collected for 2 hours surrounding the AM and PM peak
hours, since they were initially used in the peak hour models. However,
these data remain useful as a starting point to make assumptions about
external-external trip distribution patterns and the split of traffic
between trucks and passenger cars. Traffic counts are also used to
refine the survey results and together yield the final set of external
related traffic assumptions.</p>
<h3 id="external-external-trip-base-year-assumptions">External-External Trip Base-Year Assumptions</h3>
<p>Base year external-external trips are added directly into the vehicle
trip table. The external-external trips used in the 2015 model reflect
daily traffic.</p>

<p>The internal ends of the XI trips are estimated based on the total
attractions in each TAZ, and the distance from the external station. The
notion is that XI trips are produced externally to the model, and tend
to be people traveling into the model region to work or shop. The
internal trip ends for XI trips are proportional to TAZ-level
attractions, but are scaled to the external traffic counts, and
distributed using a gravity model.</p>
<p>The 2009 NHTS Add-On survey data was also used to confirm the
internal-external and external-internal trip assumptions inherent to the
CCRPC Version 4 travel model. The NHTS provides data that can be used to
evaluate the share of IX and XI trips at the district level. The figure
below compares the share of IX and XI from the survey and the model by
district. The IX calculation is the share of trips produced within the
district which go outside the region. The XI calculation is the share of
XI trips that are attracted to each district and therefore these
percentages sum to 100%.</p>
<p>The ‘Core’ district is comprised of Burlington, South Burlington and
Winooski. The ‘Inner’ district is comprised of Colchester, Essex,
Williston, Jericho, Richmond, St. George, and Shelburne. The ‘Outer’
district is comprised of Milton, Westford, Underhill, Bolton,
Huntington, Buel’s Gore, Hinesburg and Charlotte.</p>

<h3 id="external-trip-growth-rates">External Trip Growth Rates</h3>
<p>Future year external trips are assumed to grow annually at a
user-specified rate, which can vary by external TAZ. In the model, the
external trips are initially assumed to have a growth rate of 0.5% per
year but this rate is adjustable.</p>
<h2 id="trip-balancing">Trip Balancing</h2>
<p>It is common practice in transportation modeling to balance attractions
to productions. The rationale is that productions are more fundamental.
More housing will produce more trips; more retail space may simply draw
customers from other retail space.</p>
<p>This practice has important implications for using the model to analyze
regional traffic impacts emanating from changes in employment land use.
For example, if traffic impacts of a proposed major employer are to be
analyzed, the projected amount of new employment must be inserted into
appropriate TAZ in the socio-economic database. These new jobs will
attract new trips to these TAZs. However, without also increasing by
some amount the number of residences in the region, no net increase in
trips will result. Thus, these types of scenarios must be carefully
considered as to their employment and residential impacts in order for
the model to lend proper insight into transportation implications.</p>
<p>Incorporating special generator attraction rates introduces some
complexity to the balancing calculations. Balancing adjustment factors
are calculated for each of the trip purposes. It is not desirable to
factor the special generator attractions because they are based on
location specific traffic counts that reflect the unique trip making
characteristics of the land use. Therefore, only attractions that are
not special generators are factored in the balancing process. The
following general formula is used to calculate the balancing factors for
each non-truck trip type:</p>
<p>Balancing Adjustment Factor = (Productions – Special Generator
Attractions)/(Non Special Generator Attractions)</p>
<p>For trucks and NHB trips, where the connection to home-based productions
is less obvious, the destination trip end (an attraction) is balanced to
the origin trip end (an attraction).</p>
<h1 id="trip-distribution">Trip Distribution</h1>
<p>Trip distribution is the pairing of productions and attractions to form
complete trips. The pairing is done separately within each trip type.
For example, HBW productions from residences are paired with HBW
attractions at work places.</p>
<p>The trip distribution within a trip type is done using a gravity model.
The concept underlying a gravity model is that trip end locations that
are closer together will exhibit a stronger attraction than those that
are farther apart. It is also true, however, that longer trips have a
larger travel radius and therefore many more potential destinations
within that radius, as the area within a travel radius grows with the
square of the radius. Furthermore, trip end locations with higher trip
generation will be more attractive than trip end locations with lower
trip generation.</p>
<h2 id="model-structure_1">Model Structure</h2>
<p>The functional form of the distribution model is shown in Equation 1. We
have chosen to use a doubly constrained gravity model for all trip types
except the external trips, which are singly constrained to the external
trip end totals. The trip distribution model is doubly constrained to
ensure that the total productions and attractions for each zone do not
deviate from the balanced trip generation output. To doubly-constrain a
trip distribution, an iterative process is used that alternatively
balances to productions by evaluating the first equation and then
balances to attractions by evaluating the second equation. The iterative
process is complete when either the convergence criterion is met (error
of 0.01) or the maximum number of iterations is reached (30). This
function is applied separately for each of the trip types.</p>

Functional Form</p>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/media/image14.emf" /></p>
<h2 id="data-sources">Data Sources</h2>
<p>The inputs to trip distribution include productions and attractions by
TAZ, and a travel time impedance matrix representing the travel time
between each pair of TAZs. The impedance is used in the trip
distribution model to estimate friction factors, which represent the
impact of travel time on the likelihood of travel and are calibrated so
that observed trip lengths and times are reasonable and match patterns
in survey data.</p>
<p>Observed trip length distributions were estimated using the 2009 NHTS
Add-On survey data for work and non-work passenger trips. This trip
length distribution is weighted by the number of destinations
representing the attraction. Gravity model parameters were estimated to
match the surveyed trip length distribution. The gravity model trip
distribution results were then graphed with the surveyed travel length
distribution data to determine the closest approximate match for each
trip type.</p>
<h2 id="parameter-estimation">Parameter Estimation</h2>
<p>The friction factor equations take the form shown in Equation 2 and are
plotted in Figure 11 with the values scaled between 0 and 1 to be
comparable across trip purposes. HBW trips tend to be longer than NHB or
HBO trips, and this is reflected in the calibrated friction factors. The
truck trip friction factors came directly from the Quick Response
Freight Manual.</p>

<h1 id="time-of-day-distribution">Time-of-Day Distribution</h1>
<h2 id="model-structure_2">Model Structure</h2>
<p>The trip generation, trip distribution and mode split models estimate
daily trips. The traffic assignment model then assigns traffic by hour.
Trips are allocated to each hour of the day, and converted to
origin-destination format, based on time-of-day factors derived from the
2009 NHTS Add-on survey data, and modifications to match observed daily
traffic profiles from over 30 automatic traffic recorder (ATR) count
stations across Chittenden County.</p>
<h2 id="data-sources_1">Data Sources</h2>
<p>The diurnal distribution was estimated using the 1998 CCRPC household
travel survey, and adjusted to more closely match 2015 observed traffic
counts and compared to the 2009 National Household Travel Survey data.</p>
<h2 id="parameter-estimation_1">Parameter Estimation</h2>
<p>The estimate of trips by time of day is presented below for the primary
trip purposes. For home-based trips, the time-of-day (diurnal)
distribution is unique by direction (e.g. home-to-work vs.
work-to-home), but for NHB trips the directionality of the trip matrix
does not vary by time of day.</p>
<p>The diurnal distributions for HBW, HBO, and NHB trips by direction (i.e.
to or from home) are shown in Figure 12. The diurnal distributions for
light, medium, heavy commercial trips and external trips by direction
are shown inFigure 13. In each case, the “DEP” stands for departing
trips and implies trips from the production TAZ (home for home-based
trips) to the attraction TAZ.</p>

<h1 id="vehicle-assignment">Vehicle Assignment</h1>
<h2 id="model-structure_3">Model Structure</h2>
<p>The purpose of the assignment model is to locate a specific route along
links and through intersections for every vehicle trip. The vehicle
trips calculated in the mode split model, which are in the form of an
origin/destination matrix, are "assigned" to the network based on a
tri-conjugate user equilibrium model. The trip table is then input to a
user equilibrium model, which uses an iterative process to achieve a
convergent solution in which no travelers can improve their travel times
by switching to another route.</p>
<p>The assignment model includes travel delay from five sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Volume-Dependent Link Delay – calculated using volume delay functions
  documented below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volume-Dependent Node Delay – calculated using volume delay functions
  documented below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Global Turn Penalties – specified as 10 seconds per left turn, no
  delay for right and through movements. U-turns are prohibited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facility Type Penalties – specified as 50 to 60 seconds for ramp
  access from arterials, collectors, and locals to reduce the number of
  very short trips routed via interstates/freeways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specific Turn Prohibitions – These are specified in the Link Turn
  Prohibitions table, and are based on the prohibitions included in
  previous models.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The outputs of the assignment model include vehicle volumes, operating
speeds, and travel times on each link.</p>
<p>In order to develop and calibrate the model, a network including
intersection and roadway (link) characteristics must be constructed.
Once the network is complete, the model must be calibrated to a
particular period of time. The model was calibrated to 2015 AM and PM
peak hour and daily traffic conditions. The assignment calibration is
assessed based on how accurately the model output link volumes match a
file containing observed traffic counts. Calibration of the assignment
model involves adjusting the delays for turning movements and on links.
The steps required to develop and calibrate the assignment model are
outlined below.</p>

on 2005 base network link and node files obtained from the CCRPC and
imported into TransCAD, where a correspondence file between the
endpoints and nodes was created. Directionality information was added to
one-way links using ArcView.</p>
<p>This Version 4 model used the previous model road network as a starting
point and was expanded to include additional detail in downtown
Burlington, Milton, Hinesburg, and other areas that were deemed
appropriate through conversations with CCRPC staff. The additional
network detail supported the additional TAZs and centroid refinement
that was completed within Version 4.</p>
<h2 id="parameter-estimation_2">Parameter Estimation</h2>
<p>The assignment model determines “shortest” routes based on an iterative
process that achieves a convergent solution, referred to as user
equilibrium, in which no travelers can improve their travel times by
shifting routes. Travel times are complex and involve a combination of
parameters including: distance traveled, speed (based on the congestion
level and speed limit), and delays at turning locations.</p>
<p>In travel demand modeling, delay is typically considered a function of
the ratio of volume to capacity (v/c). As v/c ratios near 1.0, the
delays become more severe. The delays attributed to v/c ratios are based
on the volume-delay function parameters. The CCRPC Version 4 model
vehicle assignment algorithm uses a logit based volume delay function
developed by the Israel Institute of Transportation Research and
Planning (IITPR) shown in Equation 3. The function has the
characteristics of including both link delay as well as delay caused at
intersections. The total delay on a link is calculated as the sum of the
link delay and an estimated intersection delay.</p>
<p>Previous versions of the CCRPC travel model (prior to version 3) used a
custom node delay procedure that was developed by RSG. Link delays and
volumes were derived using a typical Bureau of Public Roads (BPR)
function. Based on the intersection approach volumes, an intersection
delay was calculated and then added to the link delay to derive total
congested travel times. While novel, this approach added considerable
complexity to the model code and resulted in relatively long vehicle
assignment runtimes for a highway network of this size. The logit based
delay function available as a default built-in function within TransCAD
calculates link and intersection delay simultaneously thereby reducing
model complexity and significantly reducing model run time. The function
parameters reflect TransCAD default values as well as calibrated
parameters applied in other regional models. The facility type specific
volume delay function parameters are presented in Table 16 below. The
resulting volume-delay curve for principal arterials is depicted in
Figure 14.</p>

<h2 id="allocation-of-intersection-capacity-to-links">Allocation of Intersection Capacity to Links</h2>
<p>Experience has shown that modeling volume-based delay at intersections
is an important function for accurately depicting transportation
systems. The Version 4 model uses a logit based volume delay function
which simultaneously calculates link and intersection delay to derive
total delay. Critical inputs to the volume delay function are the link
capacity and the intersection capacity. The link capacities are based on
the facility type specific lookup table illustrated in Table 16 above. A
link segment representing a two-lane interstate will therefore have a
total capacity of 3,800 vehicles per hour. This value would be used
(variable C=link capacity above) to derive the link delay for this
interstate link segment.</p>
<p>The derivation of the intersection capacity (variable X=node capacity
above) is not quite as straight forward. First, the user must specify a
total intersection capacity based on the configuration and geometry of
the intersection. The intersection capacity increases depending on the
number of lanes and turning bays. Therefore, an intersection with 2
approach lanes and 2 turning bays for the east-west travel will
accommodate more vehicles than an approach with just a single lane and
no turning bays. The node capacity assumptions for intersections are
presented in Figure 15. Node class definitions are presented in Table 1.</p>

Pathfinding Parameters</p>
<p>The user defined total intersection capacity must be allocated to each
approach link in order to apply the logit based volume delay function
described in the previous section. This allocation is performed in one
of two ways. One methodology is applied if the node represents a
signalized or all-way stop controlled intersection and a second method
is applied if the node represents an two-way stop-controlled. More
specifically, Class 1, Class 6, and Class 7 nodes, which are signalized
and all-way stop controlled intersections, will have node delay added to
all approaches. Class 2 nodes, which are stop-controlled, have node
delay added to the minor legs only. Minor legs are flagged and
identified by the user with the ‘Special Link Delay’ attributes in the
Endpoints-node layer (by entering the node IDs of the adjacent nodes on
the minor legs), as in the Version 3 model. Note, intersection delay is
not derived for interstate or freeway nodes as the delay is simply a
function of the link capacity for these facilities.</p>
<p>If the node represents a signalized intersection, the total intersection
capacity is allocated to the links based on the link capacity of each
approach. Let’s assume a node is coded with a total capacity of 2,000
vehicles per hour and two of the approach links have a capacity of 1,000
vehicles per lane while the other two minor approach links have a
capacity of 500 vehicles per lane. The proportional allocation of the
intersection capacity to the links would result in intersection
capacities of 1,000 vehicles per hour for the main approaches and 500
vehicles per hour for the minor approaches. The intersection capacity
values now associated with each approach link would are then used in the
node delay portion of the delay function, specifically variable X.
Figure 17 below illustrates a sample allocation of the total node
capacity for a signalized intersection.</p>

Calibration Guidelines</p>
<h1 id="mode-choice">Mode Choice</h1>
<h2 id="model-structure_4">Model Structure</h2>
<p>In a conventional urban transportation modeling system, the mode choice
model estimates the fraction of person-trips between each origin and
destination that use public transit vs. auto. Auto trips are then
converted to vehicle trips using an auto occupancy factor and the
resulting auto vehicle-trips are loaded onto the highway network.</p>
<p>The split of person-trips among modes is estimated using a logit model.
A logit model is shown in Equation 4. The share of trips using each mode
in the mode choice model is a function of the relative attractiveness of
each mode. The attractiveness of each mode is a function of the
characteristics of the mode and the preferences of different travelers.</p>
<p><span id="_Ref490738200" class="anchor"></span>Equation : Example of
Logit Model</p>
<p><img src="assets/media/image23.wmf"
style="width:3.88194in;height:1.65278in" /></p>
<p>The “utility functions” (Vs) in this equation can contain mode-specific
travel time, cost and access variables as well as traveler-specific
variables, each multiplied by parameters.</p>
<p>The “multinomial” logit model is an extension of this form that allows
comparisons among more than two alternative modes. A further extension,
the “nested” logit model allows for differential competition among
modes. A simple multinomial logit model assumes that each alternative
mode draws in fixed proportions from all other alternatives. This is an
appropriate assumption when the alternatives are substantially unique
but becomes less appropriate when subsets of the alternatives have
important shared attributes.</p>
<p>The CCRPC Version 4 model includes a pre-distribution non-motorized
binomial logit model where non-motorized shares are related to zone’s
walkability, residential density, employment density, and intersection
density, which serve as proxies for variables which tend to increase
walking and bicycling activity. A subsequent post-distribution nested
multinomial logit-form mode choice model is used to estimate the split
among auto trips, bus trips, and rail trips, and there are separate mode
choice models for work and non-work trips. There is currently no rail in
the CCRPC region, so the rail mode has not been calibrated, though the
model functionality is in place and is set to use the same choice
parameters as bus transit. This is the current Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) recommended practice for analyzing rail transit
alternatives.</p>
<p>The mode split macro skims the network for the optimal path in each
mode. Presently, this includes an auto path and a bus path. The mode
skims are then input to the mode split nested logit models and the trips
are divided among the available modes.</p>
<p><span id="_Toc491103334" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Mode Choice
Model Nesting Structure</p>
<h3 id="pre-distribution-non-motorized-mode-choice-model">Pre-distribution Non-motorized Mode Choice Model</h3>
<p>The 4-step model process arbitrarily splits a simultaneous
decision-making process into 4 sequential steps in order to facilitate
computation. This simplification can introduce a number of errors when
it comes to replicating travel behavior. Some of these errors can be
addressed programmatically or algorithmically. However, there is no
obvious way to correct for non-motorized trip behavior in a standard
4-step model formulation. In the typical 4-step model, travelers first
decide where to travel without considering potential walking
destinations, realize they can’t walk to the destination and then chose
to drive. In such a model, walk trips can only substitute or replace
very short driving trips. Moving the non-motorized mode choice ahead of
the trip distribution step attempts to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Smart Mobility Inc. (SMI) incorporated a pre-distribution non-motorized
mode choice model they have implemented in other regions to support
CCRPC’s long range plan update 2060 scenario planning process in 2009. A
binomial logit mode split model is applied to calculate non-motorized
mode shares. Non-motorized shares are calculated for all TAZ-to-TAZ
pairs based on urban form variables on each end of the trip. Then, zone
pairs with walk times greater than 20 minutes (approximately 1 mile) are
eliminated from consideration. Intrazonal non-motorized trips are always
permitted, but this approach limits the number of interzonal trips to
those that are actually feasible.</p>
<p>The urban form variables used in the logit model are zone’s walkability,
housing density, employment density, and intersection density. At first
glance it may appear strange that walk time is not included as part of
the model. However, walk time is implicitly included in the urban form
variables. When there is a high density of land uses and a dense street
grid, walk times to some destinations will be short.</p>
<p>Finally, the trip distribution and mode choice steps are adjusted to
properly account for the pre-distribution non-motorized trip model. The
walk trips are removed from the production-attraction trip table prior
to the main model distribution step, so that only motorized person trips
are then distributed.</p>
<p>RSG reviewed the operation of the non-motorized mode choice and updated
the calibration in consideration of current data on non-motorized
travel. RSG also implemented procedures to automatically calculate the
housing and employment related inputs to the household and employment
density inputs for future year model runs. The walkable zones are
indicated by the user as an input variable in the TAZ layer and are
shown in Figure 19. The TAZ based intersection density values were also
re-examined for the base year and the square root of the TAZ
intersection density (intersection nodes per square mile) was capped at
20, or 400 intersections per square mile.</p>

<h3 id="drive-vs-carpool">“Drive” vs. “Carpool”</h3>
<p>At this point no attempt has been made to explicitly model carpooling in
this version of the mode choice model. It is difficult in the CCRPC
household survey to distinguish voluntary carpooling from involuntary
carpooling and therefore little is gained by adding a carpool mode to
the mode choice model (it would function similarly to auto occupancy
factors). Therefore, it was decided to utilize auto occupancy factors,
and prior to vehicle assignment the auto trips are converted to vehicle
trips using the auto occupancy factors derived from collected survey
data.</p>
<h3 id="transit-pathfinding-and-assignment">Transit Pathfinding and Assignment</h3>
<p>The transit path-finding and assignment models are used to find and
describe the best transit paths through the network and to estimate the
number of passengers that use links and routes in a transit network. The
best path is a function of transit fares and level of service. TransCAD
provides three core transit assignment methods: all-or-nothing
assignment, pathfinder, and stochastic user equilibrium. The
all-or-nothing method is used in the CCRPC model.</p>
<p>The rules for finding the best transit path are assigned based on
professional judgment and FTA guidance on transit path-finding.
Generally speaking, out-of-vehicle travel time and transfer activity are
thought to be more onerous than in-vehicle travel time, so these actions
are penalized above-and-beyond the time required to make the transfer or
travel out of the transit vehicle. Maximums are specified for boardings,
access/egress time and wait times in order to exclude completely
illogical transit paths from being built.</p>
<p>Access to the transit system is assumed to be via non-motorized modes
for the bus system, though drive access is allowed for rail trips,
assuming a park-and-ride lot exists at the station. Walk access is
assumed for all links in the road network, except for rail links and
limited access roadways. The walk access time is an over-the-road time
computed from the centroid to the transit stop, but is divided by two to
reflect more reasonable walk access times that in reality aren’t
constrained as they are in the aggregate network.</p>
<h2 id="data-sources_3">Data Sources</h2>
<p>The CCRPC post-distribution motorized mode choice model is not estimated
from survey data, it is asserted based on professional judgment and
experience estimating mode choice models in dozens of U.S. cities. The
parameters are consistent with FTA guidance and are defensible
representations of mode choice behavior. The pre-distribution
non-motorized mode choice model was estimated from Census and 2009 NHTS
data.</p>

Volume-based Calibration Standards</p>
<h1 id="travel-model-validation">Travel Model Validation</h1>
<p>Calibration and validation is performed for each step in the model: land
use, trip generation, trip distribution, mode split, and assignment. The
model is calibrated when the model-generated road volumes reasonably
represent reality, and other key indicators and all the parameters are
reasonable.</p>
<h2 id="traffic-assignment">Traffic Assignment</h2>
<p>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has developed guidelines for
calibration standards. The following sections detail the calculation of
the various statistics used to measure calibration. Individual link
errors were calculated by subtracting the simulation volume from the
ground count for that link.</p>
<h3 id="coefficient-of-correlation">Coefficient of Correlation</h3>
<p>The coefficient of correlation, “r”, is commonly used to measure the
strength and direction between two sets of variables. An r value of 1.0
would indicate a perfect one to one correlation between the two
variables, an r value of 0 would indicate a completely random
correlation, and an r value of -1 would indicate a perfect inverse

<h3 id="root-mean-squared-error">Root Mean Squared Error</h3>
<p>The root mean squared error (RMSE) is an average link error that weights
the larger volume errors in a network. It should be noted that the RMSE
is always higher than the actual average network error because of the
weighting scheme. This is discussed in the following section on absolute
error. RMSE is calculated as:</p>

<p>where:</p>
<p>x = Ground count</p>
<p>y = Calibration volume</p>
<p>n = Number of observations</p>
<p>The RMSE should generally be less than 40%.</p>
<p>The CCRPC Version 4 daily model has an RMSE of <strong>31%.</strong></p>

<p>The CCRPC Version 4 PM model has an RMSE of <strong>35%</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="absolute-error">Absolute Error</h3>
<p>The absolute error is the absolute value of the average, unweighted
error. It reflects the average link error in the network and is
reflected in the following formula:</p>

<h2 id="transit-assignment">Transit Assignment</h2>
<p>The CCRPC Version 4 travel model also includes a transit assignment
procedure which loads the hourly transit trip matrices onto the transit
route system. The bus assignment provides a link-by-link assignment of
transit flows allowing the analyst to query total transit flow on a link
or for any individual route. The transit assignment also saves the walk
access/egress paths which allows the analyst to examine the patterns of
pedestrian travel needed to access the bus network.</p>
<p>The transit assignment was not validated for this version due to absence
of available boarding data from CCTA. With the data available, the
transit assignment can be validated by comparing model estimated route
boardings (on’s &amp; off’s) to actual observed counted route ridership. For
the validation of the transit assignment results produced by the model,
route boardings can be compared against annual CCTA ridership data.
Annual CCTA ridership by route should be converted to daily boardings
using a factor of 280 for comparison. Figure 21 below shows the daily
model boardings from transit assignment by route.</p>

<h2 id="survey-comparisons">Survey Comparisons</h2>
<p>The model output from specific steps in the model chain can be compared
against observed survey data to assure that modeled trip length
frequency distributions and mode shares are very close to observed data.</p>
<p>The value of the NHTS survey is the ability to compare observed trip
lengths to model estimated trip lengths. The survey contains a field for
reported trip distance and the add-on data also contains a ‘tripmiles’
field which is a calculated distance. The reported distances are not
generally used to validate travel model output since they are likely
rounded estimates provided by the survey respondents. For instance most
respondents would say their trip to work is about 20 minutes and/or 10
miles. The ‘tripmiles’ data is an imputed value however, the calculation
is likely done with a simplified network.</p>
<p>To conduct an apples-to-apples comparison, each survey record’s origin
and destination are spatially joined to the model’s traffic analysis
zones. We can then use the travel model network zone-to-zone distances
(skims) to compare the survey distribution against the model
distribution using a consistent set of O-D distances. Table 23 below
compares the average trip distance by trip type in miles extracted from
the NHTS survey and the CCRPC Version 4 travel model. The average trip
distances for HBW, HBO, and NHB trips are very comparable between the
survey and the model. Note, the comparisons presented below are for
internal trips (internal-to-internal) only.</p>

<p>The trip length frequency distributions were also extracted from the

overall shape of the observed frequency distribution. Figure 22, Figure

distributions for HBW, HBO and NHB trips respectively. The model and the
survey frequency distributions are examined at 2-mile distance bins (0-2
miles, 2-4 miles, etc).</p>

<p>The NHTS data includes only 18 weekday trips in Chittenden County which
use a transit mode. Therefore the survey provides little valuable
information that can be used to evaluate the transit component of the
mode choice module. However, the NHTS survey contains 459 weekday
non-motorized (walk or bike) trips in Chittenden County. About 20% of
the walk records were filtered from the analysis because the records did
not reflect actual trips but rather someone walking for exercise and/or
taking their dog for a walk. The non-motorized trips were of particular
interest because of the new pre-distribution non-motorized trip model
that uses urban form variables to calculate the share of non-motorized
trips from and to each traffic analysis zone. Table 24 shows the
comparison of home-based work, home-based other, and nonhome-based mode
shares from the model to those extracted from the 2009 NHTS Add-On
survey data. The observable reduction in auto trips and increase in
walk/bike trips in the new version of the model is a result of
discussions with the CCRPC and an analysis of rMove<sup>TM</sup> data
collected as part of this project.</p>

<h1 id="land-use-input-files">Land Use Input Files</h1>
<h2 id="model-structure_5">Model Structure</h2>
<p>Version 4 of the model removed the previous integration of a land use
model and replaced it with purpose built input files for the future
model runs out to 2050. The land use inputs were created through a
multi-step process, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Countywide and municipal control totals for household and employment
  growth were established through a robust forecasting analysis for each
  five-year increment to 2050. Municipalities reviewed and accepted the
  control totals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RSG used the land use allocation methodology to distribute the
  municipal-level control totals to the TAZ-level for each five-year
  increment to 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CCRPC, in collaboration with the municipalities, used this initial
  TAZ-level forecasts to develop final five-year TAZ-level forecasts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2025 near-term growth forecasts by TAZ was informed by a detailed
analysis of build out potential and comparing this build out to existing
land use development and an assessment of attractiveness of development
within TAZ. The build out was constrained based on known zoning,
geographic constraints, and water/wastewater capacity.</p>
<p>The initial allocation of household and employment by TAZ for 2025 was
completed using a generalized attractiveness using the equations below.
The net growth is a function of the build out potential, the existing
amount of land use, and a modifier which adjusts the desirability of a
TAZ based on who portion of its space is current build out.</p>
<p><span id="_Toc491103376" class="anchor"></span>Equation : Generalized
Attractiveness</p>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/media/image36.wmf" /></p>
<p>The actual available percentage is simply 1-existing/available. This
percentage is modified to create a curve that decreases the impact of
TAZs with very large available land percentages. The equation for
modified percentage of available land is:</p>
<p><span id="_Toc491103377" class="anchor"></span>Equation : Modified
Percentage</p>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/media/image37.wmf" /></p>
<p>The Intercept and Exponent were estimated based on historical growth.
The MP calculation results in the curve shown below:</p>
<p><span id="_Toc491103341" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Modified %
Available Developable Land</p>
<p>The generalized attractiveness (GATTn) is essentially a weighted
attractiveness of each TAZ for households and employment. The final step
is simply to allocate the control totals proportional to the generalized
accessibility.</p>
<p><span id="_Toc491103378" class="anchor"></span>Equation : Land Use
Allocation</p>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/media/image38.wmf" /></p>
<p>This creates a proportional allocation of the control total (CT) across
land use “n” for each TAZ.</p>
<h1 id="guidelines-for-working-with-complex-models">Guidelines for Working with Complex Models</h1>
<p>Four guidelines for working with complex system models are offered here.
The most important guideline for effective model use is to maintain a
“high thought-to-simulation ratio.” It is recommended that considerable
time be spent thinking through a simulation before starting the
computer. It is essential that the simulation be formulated correctly.
Understanding results of a simulation may also require a considerable
investment of time.</p>
<p>A second guideline in trying to understand a complex model run is to
study it system-wide. Focusing on a single part of the network often
results in “missing the forest for the trees.” If a decrease in
vehicular traffic in part of the network is surprising, look at the
entire network. Are people making shorter trips or changing their
destinations (distribution effect)? Are people using different modes
(mode split effect)? Have volumes in other parts of the network
increased (assignment or distribution effect)? Is there some
relationship between the increases in traffic and the unexpected
decreases?</p>
<p>A third general guideline in trying to understand a complex simulation
is to simplify the analysis. In some cases, this requires only that
outputs be looked at in a different way. For example, subtracting
volumes in two link files often provides greater insights than looking
only at levels of service. In other cases, it can be useful to perform
intermediate simulations in order to separate out the different causes
of a complex effect. For example, a vehicle trip table could be assigned
onto two networks in order to evaluate the effects of the highway
network alone. A highway improvement could be studied alone, rather than
as part of a complex package. In some cases, the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) has required some of these intermediate analyses in
demand studies for transit alternatives.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the most important things to keep in mind while modeling
with a computer simulation package is never to mistake precision for
accuracy. Every output of the model can be viewed with a high degree of
precision (i.e. high number of significant digits). However, the
accuracy of any model output is based on a set of probabilities. Thus,
the model should be used to further understand and to build intuition
for how a complex transportation-land use system will function under
varying conditions. When viewing all model outputs, we stress the
general rule that you should use the results to adjust your mental model
and that you should never abandon your own intuition without properly
analyzing not only the results but also the cause of the results.</p>
<p>The following sections provide some guidance for applying the model for
the following types of scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transportation Improvements,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes in Land Use Activity,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes in Land Use Regulation, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demand-Management Strategies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Details for model coding are provided in the following chapters.</p>
<h2 id="transportation-improvements">Transportation Improvements</h2>
<p>Evaluating transportation improvements will be one of the most common
uses of the model. Transportation improvements that can be evaluated
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>new roadways,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increased capacity on existing roadways,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>changing a 2-way street to a 1-way street,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>signalization of an intersection,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing the capacity of a signalized intersection,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>grade separation between roadways and construction of interchanges,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adding, removing, or reducing tolls on roadways,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adding new transit services, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing frequency on existing transit services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these scenarios are approached in the same general way. As part
of this project, RSG built a master network manager tool for CCRPC to
help manage various scenario networks in one master network. The tool
requires the user to prepare a list of projects to be implemented for a
particular scenario, such as adding or removing a link, changing speed
or capacities on a link, changing control type for a mode, etc. The tool
requests the user to select the master network and the list of changes
plus the transit network to produce the highway and transit network for
that scenario.</p>
<p>The complexity of transportation improvement simulations will depend on
the scale of the improvements and the time horizon of the simulation.
Distribution and mode split will adjust to changed service levels
immediately. These adjustments will generally shift some trips to the
improved service, whether it be transit or highway. However, reductions
in competing service may be much less than the increase observed in the
improved service. This result occurs frequently in congested areas
because of the network-wide redistribution of traffic.</p>
<p>In the long-term, the improved service will encourage land use
development that utilizes the service, and congestion may reappear. As
discussed above, it may be helpful to do an additional simulation where
the same trip table is assigned to both networks in order to understand
the magnitude of the land use allocation feedback.</p>
<h2 id="changes-in-land-use-activity">Changes in Land-Use Activity</h2>
<p>Another common use of the model will be to evaluate the impacts of large
land use changes on the network. This land use change would be of a
scale above and beyond that anticipated in the base land use files. The
question is whether the growth changes the county or municipal control
totals or whether it simply re-allocates the anticipated growth within a
municipality.</p>
<p>The specific land use files and years of analysis would be revised to
incorporate or shift the land use development. After the new land use
inputs are established the rest of the travel demand model would be run
as in an independent scenario year. Any roadway improvements planned in
conjunction with the development would be included in the “build”
network files. Distribution, mode split, and vehicle assignment would be
iterated.</p>
<p>There can be significant differences in results between traffic impact
analyses performed using planning models, and those done with
conventional methods.</p>
<p>In a conventional trip generation analysis, expert judgment is required
in applying pass-by and diverted trip rates, and in estimating net trip
rates for mixed land uses. The judgmental approach often ignores complex
flow conservation relationships. Although imperfect, the system planning
model methodology does implicitly incorporate pass-by, diversion, and
mixed-use developments in a consistent framework.</p>
<p>In a conventional study, distribution assumptions can be fairly
arbitrary. Common methods include distributing traffic in proportion to
current traffic, or basing distribution on a market study. The system
planning market performs distribution for the proposed development that
is consistent with distribution for other land uses. Trips are traced
all the way to the other end, and any redistribution of traffic is
included.</p>
<p>Trip assignment in a system planning model can also be more accurate
than a conventional manual assignment. The most commonly used manual
methods are based either on the existing volumes at local intersections
or on the routes with the shortest travel time. These methods assume
that there is no diversion of traffic as a result of the new
development. However, once routes become more congested, trips
previously using the roads might be diverted to alternative routes.
These diverted trips may cause "secondary" effects on previously less
traveled roadways. In this case, conventional impact analyses
overestimate primary congestion effects, but ignore secondary effects.
Secondary effects could cause an increase in both vehicle miles traveled
and vehicle hours traveled.</p>
<h2 id="demand-management-strategies">Demand Management Strategies</h2>
<p>Transportation Systems Management (TSM) and Transportation Demand
Management (TDM) prescriptions are often difficult to evaluate with a
regional model. TSM initiatives often involve improvements to signal
timing or control technology, which are best estimated through a
microsimulation model. To the extent that TSM involves creating new
capacity, as in designating an HOV lane or in designating one-way pairs,
such initiatives can be successfully modeled in a typical travel demand
modeling system.</p>
<p>Many TDM initiatives are focused on minimizing vehicle trips. As such,
TDM initiatives operate at the trip generation end of the modeling
process. The difficulty from the modeling standpoint is to accurately
represent the effects of a TDM initiative. For example, telecommuting
can reduce work commutes. However, the simple existence of a
telecommuting program does not mean that it will have high
participation. Thus, the travel modeler must transform the TDM program
into a “what if” question: “What if a telecommuting program for a major
employer reduced work commutes by 10%?”</p>
<p>Demand management strategies which may be evaluated with the model
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>parking pricing,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ridesharing programs,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>peak shifting programs,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shuttle lots,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>changes in transit operations,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>road pricing, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>high-occupancy vehicle lanes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation of demand-management strategies in system-wide
transportation planning models is a problem that modelers are working on
throughout the United States. Proposed strategies will have to be
considered one at a time. Some will either be applied manually outside
the model or will require minor changes in the model. Suggestions for
the evaluation of the policies listed in this section are outlined
below.</p>
<h3 id="parking-pricing">Parking Pricing</h3>
<p>An increase in parking pricing could be part of an employer-based
measure. For example, employers could charge employees for a parking
spot rather than guaranteeing one, or offer employees an incentive to
forego their guaranteed spot. In either case the increased cost (or
foregone incentive) associated with parking can be modeled as an
increase in the terminal time in the TAZ of interest.</p>
<h3 id="sov-reduction-strategies">SOV Reduction Strategies</h3>
<p>Ridesharing and peak shifting policies could be part of employer-based
measures, aimed at reducing peak hour trips to a certain level.
Ridesharing programs are difficult to implement in the model. If these
programs are assumed to be successful for reasons other than parking
cost, it may be necessary to use zone-specific adjustment factors.
However, without an incentive such as high parking cost, these programs
have not been successful in most areas.</p>
<p>Peak shifting programs are also problematic. Many workplaces already
have flexible working hours. Only a minority of afternoon peak hour
trips are work trips, and shifting more work trips before or after the
peak hour often has the effect of enabling greater non-work travel.</p>
<p>Testing of these alternatives with the model should rely on a
proscriptive rather than descriptive approach. In other words, the most
useful insight can probably be gained from asking a question such as
“What happens if 10% of downtown employees switch from SOV trips?” This
could be implemented by identifying the downtown TAZs to be included in
the TDM effort and reducing the Origins or Destinations associated with
those TAZs in the O-D table by 10% before the table is input to
assignment (i.e. a set of rows or columns in the O-D table is multiplied
by .9). This is currently not implemented in the model but a TDM
multiplier matrix can be used to simulate this effect. If trip making
to/from a zone is to be reduced by TDM, the corresponding row/column,
respectively, should be set to the fraction of trips remaining (in the
example above, .9). If no TDM policies are to be included, the matrix
can simply be set to contain only 1’s. The user can then multiply the
diurnal auto inputs or the hourly auto trips matrix by this TDM
multiplier and re-run the final assignment step to study the impact on
traffic in such scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="changes-in-transit-operations">Changes in Transit Operations</h3>
<p>The CCRPC model includes an assigned transit network. Extension of
service to new areas, changes in the frequency of service, and changes
in fares can all be modeled explicitly using the techniques described in
the TransCAD user’s guide. While these tools allow a great deal of
precision in transit forecasting, though, it is important to keep in
mind the distinction between precision and accuracy discussed above.
Modeling a new bus route or changes in bus frequency, or exploring a
change in ridership due to a large land-use change may be appropriate
investigations with this tool. Modeling a change in bus stop location or
a \$0.05 change in bus fare (both of which are allowed by TransCAD)
should not be expected to yield meaningful results. In many situations,
the type of off-model analysis described earlier may be a more
appropriate tool than in-model changes.</p>

<p>Both road pricing and HOV lanes may be modeled explicitly using the
functions provided by TransCAD. Refer to the TransCAD user’s guide for
detailed instructions.</p>
<h1 id="model-versions">Model Versions</h1>
<h2 id="model-versions_1">Model Versions</h2>
<h3 id="v-100-transcad-47-build-267">V 1.0.0 (TransCAD 4.7 build 267)</h3>
<p>This is the first completed and calibrated version of the CCMPO TransCad
model, which includes only the PM peak. This version was used for the
initial screening of the Circ project.</p>
<h3 id="v-110-transcad-47-build-267">V 1.1.0 (TransCAD 4.7 build 267)</h3>
<p>This is the first complete version of the CCMPO 2000 model (AM and PM)
which was completed on 07/2005.</p>
<h3 id="v-210-transcad-47-build-267">V 2.1.0 (TransCAD 4.7 build 267)</h3>
<p>This version includes the Truck model in CCMPO 2000. This version also
addressed all the enhancements that Smart Mobility observed during their
review.</p>
<h3 id="v-211-transcad-47-build-267">V 2.1.1 (TransCAD 4.7 build 267)</h3>
<p>This version corrects an error that was observed by Dave Roberts
relating to the trip generation spreadsheet being used during an
integrated run. This was introduced in the truck version (2.1.0). The
problem was that the macro inserted the external growth factor in the
wrong cell. In addition, a correction was made in the documentation that
describes the growth factor as “total growth” not “annual compounded
growth”.</p>
<h3 id="v-212-transcad-47-build-267">V 2.1.2 (TransCAD 4.7 build 267)</h3>
<p>This version builds on V2.1.1 and includes two enhancements to the
treatment of school trips in the AM model. The first enhancement is the
addition of a school trip generation rate adjustment factor for cities
and towns that do not provide school bus service (e.g. Essex Junction).
Default home-to-school trip production rates in the model are
approximately 30% lower than observed because school bus trips have been
removed since school bus trips are not modeled. This adjustment is
applied in the trip generation spreadsheet using a formula in the cells
for home-to-school productions (AM model only). Where appropriate, this
adjustment can be removed for selected TAZs by modifying the formula in
trip generation.</p>
<p>The other model improvement for school trips was to the mode choice
model. School trips are significantly more likely than other non-work
trips to be non-motorized trips, and vehicle trips to school are more
likely to be shared ride vehicle trips than are trips for other
purposes. The improvement that was made was to add a school trip
constant to the non-work mode choice model to better reflect observed
mode shares in the 1998 diary survey.</p>
<h3 id="v-213-12122005-transcad-47-build-267">V 2.1.3 – 12/12/2005 (TransCAD 4.7 build 267)</h3>
<p>This version updates the V2.1.2 documentation to include the peer review
process undertaken for the 2000 base year as well as additional
information on the Land Use Allocation Model.</p>
<h3 id="v-220-1172006-transcad-47-build-267">V 2.2.0 – 1/17/2006 (TransCAD 4.7 build 267)</h3>
<p>This version includes the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Addition of Multiple Time Step procedure. Instructions for the use of
  this procedure have been added to this documentation. In order to run
  Multiple and Single Time Steps most efficiently, the “RunControls”
  file has replaced the “Inputs” file as the file in which the user
  controls a run. As documented in the report, the RunControls file
  automatically writes one or multiple Inputs files (now referred to as
  STSInputs files). In order to use any Single Time Step procedure (e.g.
  running a report or using the Run DMA Five Times procedure) alone, the
  user now specifies the RunControls and STSInputs files to be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The method for implementing intersection delays has been modified.
  Caliper reports that the use of non-prohibition turn penalties can
  result in unstable assignment results, so we have switched to a
  procedure that adjusts free-flow travel time on individual links to
  incorporate intersection delay back onto links during assignment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AM Trip Production rates have been adjusted. As documented in the Trip
  Generation section of the report, AM counts are typically 80% of PM
  counts on the same links, but the unadjusted production rates yielded
  a similar amount of total trips in the AM and PM. Based on this
  finding we reduced AM production rates by 18%, yielding a better
  calibration to AM counts and allowing a better fit to the observed
  trip length distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After adjusting trip generation rates, distribution, mode split, and
  assignment parameters were readjusted to better match survey and count
  data. In doing this, we chose trip distribution and assignment
  parameters that are more consistent between the AM and PM time periods
  than were previously used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A “Run Reports” procedure has been added, which produces a report that
  should be used as a first-order review of model runs. Outputs include
  summaries of each model as well as a check for links with no volumes
  or nodes which far exceed capacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other minor changes have been made to the documentation in response to
  comments made during the December 2005 training session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new version naming convention has been adopted. The x.x.x version
  number can now be amended with a fourth character which will be</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a – testing version for RSG internal use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b – draft version for RSG and CCMPO review</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Omission of the fourth character will mean the version is a full release
intended for public use.</p>
<h3 id="v-221-1252006-transcad-47-build-267">V 2.2.1 – 1/25/2006 (TransCAD 4.7 build 267)</h3>
<p>A procedure has been added which writes a log of each model or iteration
which was run at the bottom of the Run Controls file along with a time
stamp.</p>
<h3 id="v-222-3302006-transcad-47-build-267">V 2.2.2 – 3/30/2006 (TransCAD 4.7 build 267)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An error in a cell reference was corrected in the TGGetFiles Excel
  Macro. Housing from a future year LUX will now be copied into column
  AJ in the Land Use tab of the Trip Generation Spreadsheet during a
  multiple time step run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An issue in the PM trip generation spreadsheet related to the external
  growth multiplier factor in future years was corrected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A modification was made to the Land Use Allocation Model. It now
  prevents any individual zone from being allocated more land use than
  is allowed in the ALU. When land must be “re-allocated” to accommodate
  this, a log of the re-allocations is kept in the AllocationReport.txt.
  Future land use totals by zone can still exceed the ALU if the Base +
  Permitted Land Use exceeds the ALU. If the total land use specified
  (Base + Growth increment) is greater than the ALU regionally, an error
  message is displayed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="v-223-442006-transcad-47-build-267">V 2.2.3 – 4/4/2006 (TransCAD 4.7 build 267)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Trip Generation spreadsheet was modified to better document
  occupied residences and group quarters in future year time step runs.
  As a result of these changes, the TGGetFiles Excel Macro was modified
  to copy household data from a future year LUX into column AK of the
  Trip Generation Spreadsheet land use worksheet during a multiple time
  step run. This change was made for both the AM and PM Peak hour trip
  generation procedures, but common practice is to run the Multiple Time
  Step operation in conjunction with the PM Peak hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model documentation updated to correctly reference land use types in
  LUAM input and output files (PER and ALN files).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="v-224-5102006-transcad-47-build-267">V 2.2.4 – 5/10/2006 (TransCAD 4.7 build 267)</h3>
<p>The land use allocation model has been modified in the following three
ways</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The LUAM will no longer subtract land use from zones where the
  user-indicated existing land use (.lux) plus permitted land use (.per)
  exceeds the allowable land use (.alu). The issue originated in V 2.2.2
  of the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An error-trapping feature has been added to prevent a run of LUAM when
  user-indicated existing plus permitted use exceeds allowable use for
  the entire region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “Land Use” feature of the drop-down menu has been removed, so that
  any runs of the Land Use Allocation Model must be done within the
  context of a Multiple Time Step run.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="v-225-8282006-transcad-47-build-267">V 2.2.5 – 8/28/2006 (TransCAD 4.7 build 267)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added back in the capability to run land-use as stand-alone feature in
  drop-down menu (so that an MTS run could be restarted from the
  land-use step if necessary)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Made it so that the first DMA iteration would use free-flow travel
  times for skims (had to fix an iteration counter)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modified the TripGen macro to write out to the hundredth decimal place
  to eliminate rounding errors and assure attractions were scaled to
  productions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added functionality in TripGen to increase the trips to BIA based on
  projected growth in passengers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added parking-zone-based reallocation of trips</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed the final DM step to save run time; the fifth DMA iteration
  now outputs logsums which are read by LUAM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relaxed the assignment convergence criteria in DMA iterations 1 to 3,
  to save run time (the convergence criteria remain the same for the 4th
  and 5th iterations)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="v-230-1222008-transcad-48-build-500">V 2.3.0 – 1/22/2008 (TransCAD 4.8 build 500)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Brought the CCMPO model into TransCAD 4.8 build 500. This involved
  fixing a number of issues created by changed implementation of macros
  by Caliper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added Rail as a functioning transportation mode. The rail process has
  park-and-ride lots included as well the right-of-way aspect of rail
  lines coded into the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Included a built-in Select Link process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updated the land use SIC coding. This is a re-categorization of the
  existing year 2000 employment data. The employment has been shifted
  between the different employment groupings (low, med-low, med-high,
  high) to better portray the actual conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjusted the Trip Generation household-#vehicle categorization in Land
  Use. If the total households in a given TAZ in the base year were
  below 100, then the town distribution is used throughout the model run
  for newly allocated households.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updated the TIP (2010) and MTP (2020) networks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="v-300-3302009-transcad-50-build-1545">V 3.0.0 – 3/30/2009 (TransCAD 5.0 build 1545)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Brought the CCMPO model into TransCAD 5.0 build 1545. This involved
  fixing a number of issues created by changed implementation of macros
  by Caliper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implemented a daily model and hourly assignments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revised the transit and roadway network databases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recalibrated the model to 2005 weekday conditions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modified the employment categories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implemented trip generation in TransCAD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recalibrated the land-use model based on a historical back-cast from
  1990-2005</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="v-31-09172010-transcad-50-build-1545">V 3.1 – 09/17/2010 (TransCAD 5.0 build 1545)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Replaced the V 3.0.0 Graphical User Interface and Scenario Manager
  with the CCMPO Menu Bar user interface utilized in previous versions
  of the CCMPO travel model which only represented AM and PM peak hour
  travel conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-instituted the use of Multi-Time Step (MTS) and Single-Time Step
  (STS) input run control text files for scenario
  management/specification and model execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post-distribution non-motorized mode choice model was replaced with
  pre-distribution non-motorized model choice model developed by Smart
  Mobility, Inc (SMI) that uses urban form variables such as housing
  density, employment density, and intersection density to estimate the
  location and magnitude of walk/bike trip-making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replaced the existing link and node delay calculations with a single
  built-in TransCAD volume-delay function which calculates and applies
  the delay from links and nodes simultaneously. This improvement
  reduces model complexity and reduces model run time significantly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trip Generation, Trip Distribution, Mode Choice and Vehicle assignment
  steps were re-calibrated and model outputs were verified against
  observed data collected as part of the 2009 National Household Travel
  Survey Add-On that was purchased by CCMPO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New version numbering scheme was introduced. First digit changes when
  a major upgrade happens, such as a recalibration. Second digit changes
  when a relatively minor improvement is made. The GISDK code resource
  files will now also be appended with the model version number and a
  third digit. Third digit will be used when we modify the version of an
  RSC file because a bug is identified.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="v-32-3-05232012-transcad-50-build-1545">V 3.2-3 – 05/23/2012 (TransCAD 5.0 build 1545)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Updated Model documentation to reflect merger of the Chittenden County
  Metropolitan Planning Organization (CCMPO) with the Chittenden County
  Regional Planning Commission (CCRPC). Most references to CCMPO were
  changed to CCRPC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Final Assignment updated to retain hourly turning movement output when
  this output type is turned on in the Run Controls file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reporting Updates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TDM reduction factor updates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Air Quality calculation report file output</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="v-40-0-08212017-transcad-70-build-12365">V 4.0-0 – 08/21/2017 (TransCAD 7.0 build 12365)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Expanded highway network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased TAZ density and renumbered TAZ layer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Created Network Manager Tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtained updated 2015 household, employment, and traffic count data
  and recalibrated model to 2015 conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updated the model code to run in TransCAD 7 (from TransCAD 5).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implemented a new and improved directory structure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[^1]: Housing from 2015 and Employment from 2016</p>
<p>[^2]: For configurations not shown in the table, including roundabouts,
    use Highway Capacity Manual or professional judgement to derive the
    total intersection capacity corresponding with LOS F.</p>
